Today was a funny day. I woke up a lot earlier than usual, went to train on the beach, barely finished it before wanting to throw up and had to sit on a bench for a few minutes to regain my strength.

Despite this less than encouraging start, went on as usual with my day crossing the better part of downtown, Zona Sul and off to Barra to spend another day working on Sa√≠daCerta.

After that gym, something I dreaded (still hate a treadmill or any variation of "you walk yet don't go nowhere exercise") but it's working. On my way back home I was feeling tired and thinking to myself about just crashing. Yet, after arriving home, I ended up cooking a poor man's excuse for dinner and decided to kick this thing off.

Getting a blog running is more of an exercise to improve my writing skills and get some thoughts out in the open for know. Got some ideas on some posts about coding, founding a company and other, kept writing but failed to achieve any degree of consistency.
