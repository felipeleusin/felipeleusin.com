## Who I am

I live in Rio de Janeiro, born and raised. As of this writing 27 years old.

## What I do

I work at my own company [dojoapps](http://dojoapps.com.br) developing products for the entertainment market. 

## Why I do it

I've been messing with computer since I can remember basically, I think my first one was a 386 something. Until today I remember how fast I felt when it upgraded to a 486dx2 and all the steps since.

About age 12 I started working with development,  web. Been having fun with it ever since.

## What I do for fun

I'm a soccer (Fluminense) fan and as of a few years ago a big american football fan (San Diego Chargers). I play in an amateur team of beach american football (Ipanema Tatu√≠s). 

I also like to travel and enjoy whatever my city as to offer, albeit being  a night person.
