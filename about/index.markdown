## Who I am

I live in Rio de Janeiro, born and raised. As of this writing 27 years old.

## What I do

I work at my own company [dojoapps](http://dojoapps.com.br) developing products for the entertainment market. 

## Why I do it

I've been messing with computers since I can remember basically, I think my first one was a 386 something. Until today I remember how fast I felt when it upgraded to a 486dx2 and all the steps since.

About age 12 I started coding, did a few websites and never stopped.

## What I do for fun

I'm a soccer (Fluminense) fan and as of a few years ago a big american football fan (San Diego Chargers). I play in an amateur team of beach american football (Ipanema Tatu√≠s). 

I also like to travel and enjoy whatever my city as to offer, albeit being  a night person. 

## Why english

I'm a primarily Portuguese speaking person. Yet, one of the reasons for creating this blog was to write about technology and software development and, as sad as it may be, when it comes to those topics english is the standard. I may end up writing something in portuguese from time to time, but will be the exception not the norm.
